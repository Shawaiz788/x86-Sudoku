- DOS emulator or Windows environment for execution
- Basic understanding of Assembly language (for code modification)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SudokuASM.git
   cd SudokuASM
   ```

2. **Assemble the code**:
   ```bash
   # For MASM
   masm sudoku.asm
   link sudoku.obj
   
   # For NASM
   nasm -f obj sudoku.asm
   link sudoku.obj
   ```

3. **Run the game**:
   ```bash
   sudoku.exe
   ```

## üéÆ How to Play

### Game Controls
- **Arrow Keys**: Navigate the Sudoku grid
- **Number Keys (1-9)**: Enter numbers into cells
- **Backspace/Delete**: Clear a cell
- **U Key**: Undo last move
- **ESC**: Exit game
- **Enter**: Confirm selection/move

### Game Rules
- Fill the 9√ó9 grid with digits 1-9
- Each row must contain all digits 1-9 without repetition
- Each column must contain all digits 1-9 without repetition
- Each 3√ó3 sub-grid must contain all digits 1-9 without repetition

### Features in Action
- **Random Generation**: Each new game presents a unique puzzle
- **Input Validation**: Invalid moves are automatically rejected with feedback
- **Undo System**: Mistakes can be easily corrected using the stack-based undo feature
- **Multiple Solutions**: Puzzles are designed to have various valid solution paths

## üèóÔ∏è Code Architecture

### Core Components

- **Board Generation Engine**: Algorithmic creation of valid Sudoku puzzles
- **Validation System**: Real-time checking of player inputs against Sudoku rules
